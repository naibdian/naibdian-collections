## NaibdiaN Iris Collection

_NaibdiaN Iris_ is the 1st collection originating from wider biomorphic visual experimentations on dynamic large particle systems inspired by biology and their emergent behaviors/dynamics.

Iris is based on Physarum mold transport systems inspired by Sage Jenson's post https://sagejenson.com/physarum and Jeff Jones's paper, _“Characteristics of pattern formation and evolution in approximations of Physarum transport networks.”_.

Iris is named after our eyes as I feel like it looks an eye but it could have been named "bigbang" too. All NFT in this collection relies on the same theme with unique color variations.


When acquiring a NFT from these collections, you're not acquiring just a static image but piece of software that simulates a truly evolving system inspired by biological organisms.
On screen, it's thousands and even millions of simple organisms evolving from an initial state and rules to a final stable state through many different phases.
You can replay the same evolution as much as you like.

> **DISCLAIMER on bad rendering on mobile or low power GPU**:
> 
> These experimentations are both an attempt to explore cool graphical visualisations but also a technical exploit trying to push current graphical system up to their limits.
> In this code, everything runs in a web browser but is actually computed mostly on GPU and large particle systems require high float precision or you start to see weird graphical issues like shape drift or bias.
> Unfortunately, many common mobile phones are currently limited in this WebGL precision scope for performance optimisation reasons and rendering is just ugly.
> In most powerful mobile phones and in future phones, it should run correctly.


### Run Environment

- PC/Mac with correct GPU.
- On mobile, a video is proposed but you can click on the link under the video to try full feature system on your mobile (see Disclaimer)

### Available user actions on NFT
- replay the same whole evolution by simply reloading the page.
- stop/restart animation at one point by clicking left-mouse or space bar if you like it and want to observe.

### Future collections

We'll release soon new cool graphical collections based on the same concept but exploring other themes and emerging behaviors.
Every collection's theme is not just a random choice, we explore a lot those systems to find peculiar or evocative or beautiful evolution, emerging behaviors or stable/unstable state
We'll also release much more complex particles systems (hundreds of thousands of particles and millions) that will require more GPU power but bring also much more complex & weird emergent behaviors.


If you like these concepts/visuals or would like custom NFT based on same theme, don't hesitate to contact on twitter [@naibdian](https://twitter.com/naibdian).

Thanks
